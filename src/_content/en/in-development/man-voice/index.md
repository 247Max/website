synopsis: "Camille is a teenager who struggles to make his voice heard. The stutter from which he suffers leads him to be rejected by others, and singularly by the girls who attract him. Except by Annabelle, but Annabelle is for other reasons, untouchable.   
At the age when sexual impulses grow, Camille sinks into frustration and loneliness. With Fabien, a high school student as unpopular as he is, he is welcomed by other young men driven by the same fixed idea: to become a man. Under the influence of a «coach in seduction», their quest for virility will gradually turn into hatred of women. Will his invisible link to Annabelle be enough to save Camille?​"
