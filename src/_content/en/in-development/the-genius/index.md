synopsis: "In a seedy flat abandoned by its tenant, Ethan Muller, a New-York gallery owner, discovers the biggest work of art ever created. He decides to showcase these uncanny drawings. The naive children’s portraits on tormented backgrounds have an immediate success: everyone talks about genius. Until a retired detective thinks he recognizes some of the faces: those of children murdered, from over-thirty-year-old cold cases.​"
