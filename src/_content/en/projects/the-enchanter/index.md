synopsis: "After the release of The Life Before Us, Romain Gary has his little cousin Paul Pavlowitch play the role of the author Émile Ajar. The press, the publishers, the readers... everyone is fooled. Well, nearly everyone. Adèle, a student in literature at La Sorbonne, from Nice (where Gary spent some of his childhood), is convinced that Émile Ajar and Romain Gary are one and the same writer. She goes to confront Gary. Will she expose him? Or will the enchanter manage to take her away in his illusion?​"
